# 🧠 CVML Lab - Computer Vision and Machine Learning

This repository contains all the code, experiments, and resources developed as part of the **CVML (Computer Vision and Machine Learning) Lab** at Dharmsinh Desai University. The structure follows a weekly format, with each subfolder corresponding to the work completed during a specific lab session.

The repository includes practical implementations of foundational and advanced techniques in image processing, computer vision, and machine learning using Python, OpenCV, and relevant libraries. These exercises are aligned with the **official lab manual** and are designed to promote hands-on learning.

📄 You can find the complete lab manual [here](CVML_lab_manual.pdf).

## 📂 Repository Structure

> Each folder contains well-commented code, sample inputs (images or datasets), and corresponding outputs.

- `week_01/`: Basic image processing operations (e.g., resizing, cropping)
- `week_02/`: Image arithmetic, bitwise operations
- `week_03/`: Filters and edge detection
- `week_04/`: Histogram equalization and thresholding
- `week_05/`: Morphological operations
- *(...add more weeks as needed...)*

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV (`cv2`)  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn *(for ML parts)*  
- (More libraries as the lab progresses...)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/userofmeet/CVML.git
   cd CVML

## 📌 Notes
- Code is modular, beginner-friendly, and well-commented.
- Each week aligns with a specific section of the CVML Lab Manual.
