# 🖼️ Image Processing Lab - 

This repository contains all the image processing codes and experiments implemented as part of the university lab manual. The structure is maintained on a weekly basis, with each subfolder representing the work completed during that week.

The repository primarily includes practical implementations of key image processing techniques using Python, OpenCV, and related libraries. These exercises are aligned with the academic curriculum and aim to deepen understanding through hands-on experimentation.
